            <h2>Timeline of Computers</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
            <p><br>In 1946, John Presper Eckert created the first computer that we know as ENIAC. 
                    The computer was as large as a room and took a lot of space. It was made at the 
                    University of Pennslyvania, and was described as the <i>"first general-purpose 
                    electronic with operational characteristics,"</i>including memory and arithmetic. 
                    However, everything changed when the IBM was launched in August 1981. The IBM was not 
                    the first personal computer, but it was the most popular. It cost around $1,565, and 
                    included a built-in speaker and the ability to do self-diagnostic checks. It also had 
                    Microsoft. 
                </br>
                <br>Just when you start to think it cannot get any better Apple creates their first product. 
                    On January 1984, Apple crates a computer with the ability to "talk" to a drawing 
                    application. This also gave over 25 million people jobs behind computers. Computers 
                    became even better in 1985, because windows 1.0 was launched to the market. Don't 
                    stop raeding now though. If you do you will never know about the british computer 
                    scientist who submitted a proposal to <i>"distributed information system,"</i> in 
                    1989. A year later, the first wedsite went live at CERN.
                </br>
                <br>Who likes to play video games? What about the playstation. Because the first playstation
                    was made in 1994. At the same time, so was the Sega Saturn. This was a major trail for the 
                    video gaming industry, and it also was a huge impact on computers. This also influced at home 
                    entertainment. Games for the Saturn and PlayStation came on CDs rather than cartridges. Two 
                    popular games then were "Nights into Dreams" and "Final Fantasy VII".
                </br>
                <br>The next development in computers happend in the 2000's. Smaller laptops, phones, and tablets 
                    were made in the 2000's. An almost every American house you can find a type of computer. Because a 
                    massive adoption of broadband internet across the world devolped in this century, with Samsung and 
                    Apple as the top competitors. Now we have high-speed downloads, super-fast browsing, high-resolution 
                    streaming and much more. The internet became a necesity to America.
                </br>
                <br>That brings us to today's socicity. When coronaviris started, and states all over the country began to 
                    use computers daily. They would use them for eduction, jobs, meetings, and ect.. In 2020-2021 
                    computers became something needed everyday. Without computers the coronaviris would have speard
                    more severly, effecting more people. This is how computers devolped over the years (I hope they 
                    don't take over in the future lol).
